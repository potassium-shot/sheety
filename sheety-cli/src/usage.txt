Usage:
	sheety <command> [options]

commands:
	cat <file 1> <div 1> <file 2> <div 2> <file 3> <div 3> ...
		Allows concatenating existing sprite sheets into a single. File order matters.
		<div> specifies the division of the file (see div section of this help message)
		May also be used with a single sprite sheet.
	
	del <file> <div> <index>
	OR
	del <file> <start index> <end index exclusive>
		Removes the sprite of the sheet at <index>, or all sprites of the sheet between <start index> and <end index exclusive>.
		See div section of this help message for help on <div>.
	
	get <file> <div> <index>
		Gets a single sprite at <index> of sprite sheet <file>
		See div section of this help message for help on <div>.
	
	slice <file> <div> <start index> <end index exclusive>
		Gets an array of sprites from <start index> to <end index exclusive> of sprite sheet <file>
		See div section of this help message for help on <div>.

options:
	-o <path>
	--output <path>
		Specifies path for the output. If this option is omitted, it defaults to './sheety-result.png'
	
	-d <distrib> <arg>
	--distribution <distrib> <arg>
	 	Sets the distribution rules to use when making a new sprite sheet.
		
		If <distrib> is columns, <arg> specifies the amount of columns enforced.
		If <distrib> is lines, <arg> specifies the amount of lines enforced.
		If <distrib> is packed, <arg> can be 'columns' or 'lines' to specifie which of the both should be favoritised.

		Examples:
			'--distribution columns 5' will force the resulting sprite sheet to have exactly 5 columns.
			'--distribution packed lines' will force the resulting sprite sheet to be packed, favoritising line
			length over column length.
		
		If this option is omitted, it defaults to 'packed columns'

div:
	A div is used to determine how to divide a sprite sheet.
		'cells 30x40' divides it into 30 by 40 cells.
		'sprite 30x40' divides it into individual sprites of 30 by 40 pixels.
		'single' considers the whole image as a single sprite.

		'cells 20' is equivalent to 'cells 20x20'
