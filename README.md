# Sheety

Sheety is a soon-to-be sprite-sheet manipulation program written in Rust.
It has a Rust library crate for its API and #todo a binary crate for a CLI app built on top of the API.
Maybe even a GUI if I feel like it/have time for it.

## Todo:
- [ ] API
	- [ ] reordering of sprites
	- [x] sprite-sheet concatenation
	- [x] sprite import
	- [ ] sprite-sheet import
	- [ ] individual sprites export
	- [ ] sprite-sheet export
	- [ ] documentation
- [ ] CLI
- [ ] publish on crates.io
- [ ] GUI (maybe)
